# GameShop
Management systems project demo designed for a play store

Requirements

1. An environment where players can register to the system, update their information and delete their records can be simulated. We want to verify the query of customer information using e-government systems. (In e-government systems, verification is done with TcNo, Name, Surname, Year of Birth. It is enough to simulate the service that will do this.) (Like logging)

2. The sales environment where the game can be sold can be purchased simulated (Sales made must be associated with the player.

3. Simulate the use of new campaigns, deletions and updates of the campaign.

4. Campaign integration in sales will be simulated.
